SETaP EcoCalc notes

“The application that we will be developing will be an EcoCalculator. 
The application will allow the user to track their carbon footprint and give the user suggestions on how they can reduce their carbon consumption.” The target audience for this app is commuters and/or people who travel for work regularly.  (Team 4D, 2019)

The app will use satellite data to track the user’s movements across the day and to determine their mode of travel via speed and location. It will use estimates of the vehicles based on averages of different models. The user example is reluctant to actively contribute to known data.As such, we will need to make heavy use of estimates. 

The user would prefer a selection of quantifications for the carbon footprint to choose from/see. e.g. tons of CO2, trees saved, sea level change.
